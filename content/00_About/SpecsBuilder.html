DevSpex is a little PHP app created in order to make dev specs writing more "dev-friendly".<br>
Did you finish and test a module ? Describe it in a simple HTML file with tags around your text (no DOCTYPE !), while you brains are still hot. <br>
At every moment, your documentation is ready to be consulted / printed / copied as HTML or plain text / or exported as a DOC file.
Without leaving your dev environment, you just have to integrate this repository to your app's folder. <br>
You can see the result thanks to the index.php file placed at the root of this repository.<br>
You are going to put your documentation in content/. By default, a basic structure is implemented. You can change the name of the folders and files existing in content/, and create as many as you want.
The files have to be inserted with an .html extension and HTML tags are supported, of course - however, don't care about DOCTYPE, HTML's head content and body tags, which are handled by index.php when it merges the specs.
